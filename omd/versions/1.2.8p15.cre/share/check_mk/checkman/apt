title: Check for normal and security updates via APT
agents: linux
catalog: os/misc
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check checks for available normal and security updates by trying
 {apt-get update} or {apt-get dist-upgrade} without actually installing
 packets. It works on Debian and Ubuntu. You need to deploy the plugin
 {mk_apt} in order for the check to work. It is recommended to install
 this plugin with asynchronous execution and at an interval with at
 least one hour.

 The check gets critical if there are security updates available.
 It gets warning, if there are other updates available. These two
 states can be overriden via a WATO rule.

inventory:
 One service will be created for each system where the {mk_apt}
 plugin is being installed and the command {apt-get} is present.
