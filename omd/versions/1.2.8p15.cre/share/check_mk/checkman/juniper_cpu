description:
 This check is obsoleted by juniper_cpu_util!
 The check was reporting load readings, not utilization! Those load readings
 aren't actualy usable as the number of cores processing that load isn't known.

perfdata:
 util1: The CPU utilization of the last 1 minutes in percent.
 util5: The CPU utilization of the last 5 minutes in percent.
 util15: The CPU utilization of the last 15 minutes in percent.

inventory:
 Since this check is obsolete, no items are discovered

[parameters]
warning (int): The percentage of CPU utilization that triggers a warning level.
critical (int): The percentage of CPU utilization that triggers a critical level.

[configuration]
juniper_cpu_default_levels (int, int): Default levels for warning and critical used
  by inventorized checks. This is preset to {(80.0, 90.0)}
