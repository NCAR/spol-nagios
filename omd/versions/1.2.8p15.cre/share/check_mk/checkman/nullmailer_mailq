description:

 This check monitors the number of deferred mails in the outgoing mail
 queue, as sent by the linux agent of Check_MK.

 This check creates one service per host which represents the state
 of the outgoing mailqueue.

 The check will result in WARNING/CRITICAL states when the number of items
 in the queues have reached the defined thresholds.

perfdata:
 Two variables for each queue: the number of messages and the
 total size of the messages in the queue in bytes.

inventory:
 On each system which provides the {nullmailer-send} command one service is created.
