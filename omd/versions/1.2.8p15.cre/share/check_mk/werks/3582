Title: check_mail: Fixed issue with processing multipart mails
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p3

Class: fix

When the check is configured to forward mails to the event console,
it was unable to parse multipart mails. This has been fixed. The
events now get the contents of the first text/plain part added until
the configured body limit.
