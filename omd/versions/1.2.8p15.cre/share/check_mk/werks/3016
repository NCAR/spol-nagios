Title: mk-job: scheduled jobs are now always executed despite of any status file permission problems
Level: 1

The mk-job call could fail if the status file for this command could not get created
due to permission problems. With this fix insufficient permissions now only prevent the creation of the status file.
The command itself is executed nevertheless.
