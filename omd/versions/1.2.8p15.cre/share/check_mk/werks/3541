Title: esx_vsphere_hostsystem.state: no longer crashes when data is missing
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p5
Date: 1465286242
Class: fix

Sometimes ESX systems decide not report any data at all.
This check no longer crashes when this happens, it simply reports UNKNOWN.

An upcoming update will change this behaviour so that the checks will go stale
in case the data is missing.
