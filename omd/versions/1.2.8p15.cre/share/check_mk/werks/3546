Title: Drastically sped up response time on querying single aggregations

Querying a single aggregation (e.g. through <i>Filter: Aggregation name (exact match)</i>) took
considerably longer than it should. The query time was proportional to the number of
available aggregations. This has been fixed.

The main beneficiary of this fix is the active check "Check State of BI Aggregation".
