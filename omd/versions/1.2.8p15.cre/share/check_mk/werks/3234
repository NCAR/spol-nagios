Title: Make unixcat more robust
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b3
Date: 1456222762
Class: fix

Previously it could happen that unixcat crashed when system resources and/or
limits were low, especially the nproc limit.  Now we emit sensible error
messages and exit with new return codes (5 and 6).
