Title: Fixed shutdown of Nagios core with Livestatus module
Level: 1
Component: livestatus
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b2

Class: fix

The Nagios core no longer hangs now during shutdown when the Livestatus
module is used. This resulted in a long delay before the core was finally
killed forcefully.
