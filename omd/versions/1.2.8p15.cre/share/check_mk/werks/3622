If you create an own check that outputs very large metrics then the
labelling of the vertical axis in a graph would try to display numbers
like 1000000000000, with the problem that the prefix 1000... is not
visible.

Number larger than 99999 are now being displayed in exponential
syntax, e.g. 1.0e6 and are thus correctly being displayed.
