Title: Unbreak COMMAND handling
Level: 1
Component: livestatus
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b3
Date: 1456481971
Class: fix

Due to a recent bug, only the first of several COMMANDs piped into
livestatus was executed. This made e.g. replaying the output of cmcdump
impossible. This has been fixed now.
