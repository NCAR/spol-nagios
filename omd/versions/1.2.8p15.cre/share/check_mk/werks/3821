Title: WATO Network Scan: Fixed risk of loosing site tags when performing a network scan
Level: 1
Component: wato
Class: fix

A network scan on a folder could cause the loss of any site tags configured in this
folder. As a result, these hosts were monitored multiple times on different sites,
when a distributed WATO setup was used.

Developer note: This only happened when a "fresh" apache process handled this request.
Any hosttags and site defines were missing..
