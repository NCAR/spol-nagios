Title: mounts: Fix exception when displaying check parameters in WATO services list
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p1
Date: 1462963852
Class: fix

The reason for this exception was that the autodiscovery now creates Unicode
strings while the WATO parameter definition only allowed normal strings.
