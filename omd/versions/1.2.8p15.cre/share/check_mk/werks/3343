Title: MKP: Verifying minimal version of packages during installation
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b8

Class: fix

The minimal required version of MKPs was only an informational field before
this change. Now the version is checked during installation of the MKPs. When
the package requires a newer version than you are currently using it refuses
the installation.
