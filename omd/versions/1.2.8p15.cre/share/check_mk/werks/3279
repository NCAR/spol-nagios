Class: fix

For several LDAP sync plugins it is possible to configure the LDAP attribute
for syncing. For example for the mail sync plugin you can configure which LDAP
attribute to use as source for the mail address.

The default values of these attributes depend on the selected LDAP type. This
special case was not working in 1.2.8x and has beend fixed now.
