Title: cmk -I without host specification now (again) always uses cache files

Class: fix

If you do a discovery of all hosts then <tt>cmk -I</tt> always defaulted to
using cache files (like an implicit <tt>--cache</tt>). This behaviour has
gone lost recently and is no revived. You always can use <tt>--no-cache</tt>
if you want fresh data.
