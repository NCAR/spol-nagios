Title: windows agent: relative paths to mrpe scripts are now treated as relative to the agent installation directory

Class: fix

contrary to how it was documented, mrpe scripts with relative paths were expected in the directory
relative to the current working directory, which would usually be c:\windows\system32

In addition, it was not possible to include spaces in the script path which made it very difficult
to reference mrpe scripts in c:\program files...

This has now been fixed and mrpe configuration should now work as documented.
