Title: mk_logwatch (linux): now able to handle queries from multiple servers (no longer loosing data)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.8b11

In earlier versions mk_logwatch only had one statefile for all incoming queries.
Any newly found loglines were sent to one server - subsequent queries from other servers got nothing.
With this version each IP address now has its own statefile.
So you can now monitor the same system from multiple servers without the risk of loosing log
messages. Important: Multiple OMD sites running under the same server IP address still steal
log messages from one another.
