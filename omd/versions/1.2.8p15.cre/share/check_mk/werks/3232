Title: BI: Only querying site of host for specific host status info

BI communicates via livestatus with the sites to first gather a list of
all hosts in all sites. Once this has been done BI knows which host
status can be found on which site.

But this info was not used when fetching the states of the hosts. The
host state queries were always sent to all sites causing a lot of needless
livestatus queries.

This should improve the performance of the BI views when having a higher
number of sites or some sites which have a bad connection.
