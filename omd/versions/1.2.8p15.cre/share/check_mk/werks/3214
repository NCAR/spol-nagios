Title: Removing SNMP checks for non SNMP hosts and agent based checks for non agent hosts
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b2
Date: 1455620283
Class: fix

When changing the agent type of a host, for example from Agent to SNMP, vice versa or
from Agent+SNMP to only SNMP it could happen that former discovered services of now
disabled protocols were left assigned to a host leading to still contacting the host
with the disabled protocol. This could only be solved by rediscovering the services
of this host.

This has now been changed to disable the services right after next restart/reload of
the core after changing the agent type.
