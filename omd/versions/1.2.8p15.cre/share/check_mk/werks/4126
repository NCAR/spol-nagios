Title: apache_status: Handle https requests lo localhost in case of certificate mismatch
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p15
Date: 1480861671
Class: fix

If the webserver is serving the status site from apache over https and the certificate
does not match the server name, the request was ignored. This is fixed now. The request
is rewritten to localhost without encryption.
