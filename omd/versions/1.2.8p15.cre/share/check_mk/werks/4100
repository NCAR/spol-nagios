Title: mk_mysql: Only perform queries if mysqladmin ping is successful#
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8p15

Class: fix

Previously, a dead MySQL daemon would lead to the mk_mysql plugin causing
high server load. This has been fixed by performing the more detailed queries
only if the mysqladmin ping is successful.

Thanks to Evy Bongers for this patch.
