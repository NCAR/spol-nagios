Title: Default cloned views to be not public
Level: 2
Component: multisite

Class: feature

If you create a view as a clone from an existing view than the new view
defaults <b>not</b> to be public. Previously the public-flag was cloned
as well. That could lead into trouble by an admin overriding the views of
others by that way.
