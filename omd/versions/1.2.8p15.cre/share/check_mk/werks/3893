Title: Predictive levels: Improved handling of broken prediction files (empty files)
Level: 1
Component: core
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.8p12
Date: 1475061250

In previous versions it could happen that the predictive levels feature created empty
(zero byte sized) files below var/check_mk/prediction which made the predictive levels
not work anymore for the affected service. This situation is now being repaired
automatically.
